# Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)


## **Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn**
- Predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
- You can use R, Python SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
- Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

## **Problem statement**
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

## To predict:
